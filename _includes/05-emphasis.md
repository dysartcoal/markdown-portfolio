I have some amazing attributes:
- I am **very** good at shouting at my kids.  
- Of all the _thousands_ of people I know in the world, I am the one with the least patience when it comes to people not trying hard enough.  I cannot stand people who do not try.  Seriously, _I just can't stand it!_
- Although I have a significant number of personality flaws when it comes to my private life, I am an employer's dream:  I work hard, check things thoroughly, get on well with people and consistently deliver above expectations on anything I'm tasked with.  This could, of course, be down to the fact that I've never been tasked with anything challenging... :laughing:
